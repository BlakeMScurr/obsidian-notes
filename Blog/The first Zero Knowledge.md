(intro/purpose)

You want to understand zero knowledge proofs but the literature is too dense, and the blog posts are too vague. This is your path to the wellspring of the literature. We'll introduce the major ideas from Goldwasser, Micali, and Rackoff's cornerstone paper introducing zero knowledge proofs, and prepare you to dive into the literature yourself.

(intro/format)

We will start by exploring the meanings of several crucial intuitive terms; knowlege, proof, computation, distinguishability, and communication. Then we construct an informal analogy for a zero knowledge interactive proof in general. Then we will sketch the formalization. Then we will introduce a real proof system that satisfies our formalisation.
