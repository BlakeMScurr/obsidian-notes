# Cognitas

## The Problem
The world's power is increasingly accuring to tech companies and other cyborgs.
They are fundamentally inscrutible and unaccountable.
Nobotic changes that.

## The idea

Nobotic is a platform that lets you build a global scale SaaS on top of a strong L1 consensus layer like Ethereum.
In a Nobotic world, all the FAANG and the other power centres we know and love still exist, but every result from a query has a cryptoeconomic guarantee that the result is accurate, and that the system has been run in accordance to specified rules.
In the ideal world, this would lead to a web without centralised censorship or manipulation, though of course one can always filter the results of ones own queries.

## The Roadmap

### Nobotic
The preliminary step is building a peer to peer app that would benefit from a centralised but accountable server. This will be a series of blockchain games, designed to cost no gas, and to be un-bottable.

### TwoFive
Nobotic will initially be written with a server to pass messages between peers. The next step will be to run the server in its own ForceMove-esque game such that it must perform its role as advertised - that it must queue you as you wish, and you must be able to see what others have submitted to the server.

### Cognitas Proper
Then the cognitas framework/network will be deployed. It will be composed of TwoFive servers operating as a marketplace for TwoFive apps. One can write a super scalable web backend by just writing some smart contracts and signing a contract with a TwoFive provider.

Saases that run on Cognitas will be able have their own token and give proven benefits to token holders, essentially taking Saas public on chain and getting access to defi capital up front, with all the cryptographic guarantees that crypto investors desire before aping into projects.
