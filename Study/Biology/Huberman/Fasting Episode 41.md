What does GLP1 stand for?
?
Glucagon-like peptide 1
<!--SR:2022-11-24,38,230-->

When is GLP1 secreted?
?
In a fasted state
<!--SR:2022-11-29,43,250-->

What is GLP1 involved in?
?
Mobilising energy sources like fat, carbohydrates, or even muscle
<!--SR:2022-11-05,13,210-->

What is lipolosis?
?
Using fat as an energy source in the body
<!--SR:2022-12-01,45,250-->

Do insulin and blood glucose levels change immediately? Why is this important?
?
No, over the course of roughly hours. Because the benefits of time restricted eating come from being in certain "states" or "conditions" for certain amounts of time.

Do you lose fat faster on a low fat or low carb diet?
?
No difference, assume both have a caloric defecit.
