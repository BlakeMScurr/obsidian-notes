What does GLP1 stand for?
?
Glucagon-like peptide 1
<!--SR:!2023-02-16,84,230-->

When is GLP1 secreted?
?
In a fasted state
<!--SR:!2023-03-17,108,250-->

What is GLP1 involved in?
?
Mobilising energy sources like fat, carbohydrates, or even muscle

What is lipolosis?
?
Using fat as an energy source in the body
<!--SR:!2023-03-22,110,250-->

Do insulin and blood glucose levels change immediately? Why is this important?
?
No, over the course of roughly hours. Because the benefits of time restricted eating come from being in certain "states" or "conditions" for certain amounts of time.
