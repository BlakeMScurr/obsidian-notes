## Transparency vs Universality

Will the descendants of STARKs of PlonK win?

Both seem to have solved the trusted setup problem, but they've probably done it differently, and perhaps in a sufficiently different way that the literature will improve one more than the other. I'd like to know which is better, and which has greener pastures so I can stake my claim somewhere.

## What can I create?
I want to excellent products and protocols. The combination of offchain, zk, and vailidity can allow one to construct incredibly powerful protocols. I want to understand the zk and validity tools at my disposal so I can make sense of the tradeoffs and apply the right proof protocols in the right places.

What system has the most verifier?

Which systems are most ammenable to recursion?

## What are the principles?

Simply learning/memorising the state of the art will not be useful if I can't make sense of the origins and why certain limitations are placed on various systems. Hence, to get an efficient and quickly updating knowledge base, I should understand the history and theory of the systems.
